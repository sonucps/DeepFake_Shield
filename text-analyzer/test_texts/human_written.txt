AI is getting better at writing, but it's not perfect yet. Sometimes the text feels a bit off - too formal or repetitive. I've noticed that AI often uses the same phrases over and over. The technology is impressive, but it still makes mistakes that a human writer wouldn't. We need to be careful about how we use these tools.
